-Typescript typechecking happens during compile time, for runtime checks we can use library like zod 

Type inference:

Type inference refers to the ability of a programming language's compiler to automatically deduce the data type of a variable, function argument, or return value based on its context. This eliminates the need for explicit type annotations in many cases, making the code more concise and easier to write.

However, there are situations where explicit type annotations might still be useful:

Complex Logic: When dealing with intricate logic or multiple data types within a variable, type annotations can enhance clarity.
Large Codebases: In extensive projects, explicit types can improve code understanding for developers working on different parts.

--------------

.gitignore-> only .ts/.tsx , tsconfig.json and package.json should be pushed to github else should be in gitignore

--------------

Difference between .ts and .tsx (just like .js and .jsx)

Choosing the right extension:

Use .ts for files that don't involve JSX and only use pure TypeScript features.
Use .tsx for files that define React components and leverage JSX syntax along with TypeScript.
